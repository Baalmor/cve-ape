# cve-ape
CVE Ape is a fairly simple tool free and open source tool which helps to find all registred at the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) listed at the package list.

Main usage of this tool is to help with review of linux based IOT devices, but could be also integrated at the CI/CD pipelines to maintain better level of security.

This is not very precise tool because is not checking any backports nor vendors if not supplied specifically.

The tool is downloading and creating a local CVE database at `~/.cache/cve-ape/` folder. It can be used offline, but only after a first update as it has to create a database.
## How to use
You need to generate a pkglist yourself first. Currently only the following format is supported, but CSV will be added too later.

*Example:*
```
curl-7.77.0-r0
dbus-1.12.20-r0
dbus-libs-1.12.20-r0
device-mapper-libs-2.02.187-r0
dhcpcd-8.1.9-r0
disk-utils-0.3.0_rc1-r0
dnsmasq-2.85-r0
```
then you can run a tool using this command:
`cve-ape -L pkglist.txt`
## Disclamer
Some parts of the code were taken as is from another open source project [cve-bin-tool](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool) from Intel. A lot of respect should be given to those guys.
